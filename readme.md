This is the "Data Stream Mining" project of Yuyan Zhao and Bérénice Jaulmes.
It implements the Bayes UCB algorithm for the River library. We chose to use a Bernouilli distribution when computing the posterior distribution. 
This work could be extended to include other distributions, such as the Gaussian distribution.
The "init.py" file is there to serve as an example of how to use the Bayes UCB class.
