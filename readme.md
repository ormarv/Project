This is the "Data Stream Mining" project of Yuyan Zhao and Bérénice Jaulmes.
It implements the BayesUCB algorithm<sup>[1]</sup> for the multi-armed bandit problem with the River library. 
We chose to use a Bernouilli distribution when computing the posterior distribution. This work could be extended to include other distributions, such as the Gaussian distribution.
